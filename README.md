## About

I build web applications with the belief that **clarity is not a style, but an ethic**.

Most of my work lives between frontend experience and backend structure — where decisions accumulate over time, and small choices quietly shape how a system behaves, ages, and is understood.

I’m currently working as a web developer at **Erason**, contributing to software meant to be *used*, not just demonstrated.

## On building

I see software as something closer to architecture than machinery.

- A system should reveal its intent.
- Complexity should appear only when it earns its place.
- Code is read far more often than it is written.
- Good interfaces feel calm because they carry less uncertainty.

I try to design and implement with these ideas in mind.

## Tools & practice

I don’t collect technologies.  
I use them deliberately.

**Frontend**
- Vue.js, React, TypeScript, Javascript  
- Tailwind CSS, modern CSS

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express  
- Python, Django REST Framework

**Data**
- PostgreSQL  
- MongoDB

Tools change. Principles remain.
